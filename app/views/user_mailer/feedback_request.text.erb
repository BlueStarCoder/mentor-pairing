Hey <%= @giver.name %>!

How did your pairing session with <%= @receiver.name %> go? Please take a minute to send a thank you email to <%= @receiver.first_name %> at: <%= @receiver.email %>! Follow up on how your session went! Give them the title of that movie you couldn't remember until after the session!

Also, please provide some feedback for them at our feedback page (found at <%= new_appointment_feedback_url(@giver.activation_code, :appointment_id => @appointment.id) %>). We'll pass it along to them for you.

Thanks,
Dev Bootcamp
